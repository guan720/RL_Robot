## Overview

Real-time deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies requires **asynchronous execution**:
the next action chunk is computed while the current one is still running. That creates a
**prediction–execution misalignment** — by the time a chunk takes over, the observation it was
computed from is already stale — which shows up as inter-chunk discontinuity. Existing methods
either smooth the chunk boundary superficially, pay for costly policy optimization, or roll the
proprioceptive state forward while ignoring the visual observation entirely.

The paper additionally reports results on the **Kinetix** simulator (12 dynamic environments,
`d ∈ [0, 4]`) and on **real-world bimanual manipulation** with an AgileX Cobot Magic robot
(*Stack Plates*, *Fold Towel*, *Hang Cups*). Those are outside the scope of this release, which
covers the LIBERO pipeline.

## Requirements

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| GPU | ≥ 24 GB VRAM for evaluation|
| Python | 3.10+ |
| Stack | LeRobot v0.5.1, LIBERO, robosuite, MuJoCo, PyTorch |

---

## Environment Setup

### 1. Python environment

Install the LeRobot v0.5.1 stack together with LIBERO, robosuite and MuJoCo. The launch scripts call
`python3`; point them at another interpreter with `PYTHON=/path/to/python`.

If LeRobot is installed in that environment, nothing else is needed. If you run from a source
checkout instead, set `LEROBOT_ROOT=/path/to/lerobot` (or pass `--lerobot-root`).

### 2. Backbone checkpoint

Either a LIBERO-finetuned **π₀.₅** (plus a PaliGemma tokenizer directory), or a LIBERO
**SmolVLA-450M** checkpoint. The pretrained weight is never modified.

### 3. LIBERO dataset

```bash
huggingface-cli download HuggingFaceVLA/libero --repo-type dataset \
  --revision 86958911c0f959db2bbbdb107eb3e17c5f9c798e \
  --local-dir /path/to/libero
```

That revision is pinned: `assets/libero_action_stats.json` was extracted from its `meta/stats.json`,
and the action normalization must match.

### 4. Paths

Every path comes from an environment variable or a CLI flag — nothing is hardcoded.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POLICY_PATH` | Backbone checkpoint directory (π₀.₅ or SmolVLA) |
| `DATASET_ROOT` | Local LeRobot LIBERO dataset root |
| `TOKENIZER_PATH` | External PaliGemma tokenizer (**π₀.₅ only**; SmolVLA ships its own) |
| `BANK_DIR` | Visual-latent bank directory (training) |
| `CORRECTOR_CKPT` | State correction module checkpoint (default `weights/corrector.pt`) |
| `LEROBOT_ROOT` | *Optional.* LeRobot source checkout, when it is not installed |
| `PYTHON` | *Optional.* Interpreter for the launch scripts (default `python3`) |

```bash
export DATASET_ROOT=/path/to/libero
export POLICY_PATH=/path/to/pi05_libero_finetuned
export TOKENIZER_PATH=/path/to/hf_paligemma_tokenizer
```

---

## Training

Steps 1–4 reproduce the shipped checkpoints. To evaluate only, skip to
[Evaluation](#evaluation) — `weights/` already contains their outputs.

### 1. State correction module

Reads only the dataset's state and action columns; no policy, no images.

```bash
launch/train_corrector.sh 0 outputs/corrector/full_state_residual_d0_20.pt
```

`d ~ U{1..20}`, AdamW, batch 512, cosine LR to 0, 100k steps.

### 2. Visual-latent bank

Each demonstration frame is embedded exactly once, at the same boundary the evaluation driver
injects at — so training and deployment see identical latents by construction. Delays are resampled
from this bank at training time, giving full (frame × delay) coverage with no per-pair duplication.

```bash
BANK_DIR=outputs/latent_bank_pi05 OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/latent_bank_pi05 launch/collect_pi05.sh 0 0 1
```

The last two arguments are `worker_id` and `num_workers`: run one process per worker on its own GPU,
all writing to the same `OUTPUT_DIR`, to shard a large bank across cards.

### 3. Sidecar and statistics

```bash
python predictor/collect_state_sidecar.py \
  --dataset-root "$DATASET_ROOT" --dataset-revision 86958911c0f959db2bbbdb107eb3e17c5f9c798e \
  --bank-dir outputs/latent_bank_pi05 \
  --output outputs/latent_bank_pi05/state_task_sidecar.pt

python predictor/compute_latent_stats.py --bank-dir outputs/latent_bank_pi05
```

### 4. Observation prediction module — two phases

| Phase | Loss | π₀.₅ | SmolVLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — reconstruction | `mse 1.0` | lr 1e-4, batch 64 | lr 3e-4, batch 256 |
| 2 — policy consistency | `+ policy 10.0`, resumed from phase 1 | lr 1e-4, batch 16 | lr 1e-4, batch 32 |

Both anneal the learning rate on a cosine schedule to `1e-6` and sample `d ~ U{1..20}`.

```bash
BANK_DIR=outputs/latent_bank_pi05 launch/train_predictor_phase1_pi05.sh 0

BANK_DIR=outputs/latent_bank_pi05 \
  launch/train_predictor_phase2_pl_pi05.sh 0 outputs/predictor_pi05_phase1/predictor.pt
```

The cosine (feature) term is optional: set `FEATURE_WEIGHT=0` on phase 1 to train on MSE alone.

---

## Evaluation

All requested delays run **concurrently** in one asynchronous vector-env batch
(`n_envs = b_t × n_delays`), so a whole delay sweep costs one pass of environment stepping on one
GPU rather than one pass per delay.

```bash
launch/eval_pi05.sh 0 weights/predictor_pi05.pt outputs/eval_pi05
python eval/aggregate.py outputs/eval_pi05
```

Defaults: replan stride `s = 25`, delays `5,10,15,20`, 10 tasks per suite, 50 episodes per task,
seed 7, and the four suites in sequence with step caps `libero_spatial` 220, `libero_object` 280,
`libero_goal` 300, `libero_10` 520.

Override any of them by environment variable:

```bash
DELAYS=5 TASK_IDS=0 NUM_TRIALS=2 CPU_FRACTION=0.05 \
  launch/eval_pi05.sh 0 weights/predictor_pi05.pt outputs/smoke libero_spatial:220
```

---

### Pretrained weights

| File | Backbone |
|---|---|
| `weights/predictor_pi05.pt` | π₀.₅ |
| `weights/predictor_smolvla.pt` | SmolVLA-450M |
| `weights/corrector.pt` | — |

---

## Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The `-s tests -t .` form matters: some environments ship a `tests` package that shadows a bare
`python -m unittest tests.foo`. These cover the evaluation path — the handoff schedule, the driver's
observation slicing and action assembly, the per-episode metrics, and result aggregation.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Two concurrent runs corrupt each other's compiled kernels | Give each run its own `TMPDIR`, `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR` and `TRITON_CACHE_DIR`. The launch scripts already do this per output directory. |
| robosuite asserts on `MUJOCO_EGL_DEVICE_ID` at import | Set it to the **physical** GPU id before launching; `common.runtime.normalize_single_visible_egl_device` imports robosuite and only then rewrites it to the in-process id `0`. Do not reorder those steps. |
| DataLoader workers die at step 0 | Use a **short** `TMPDIR`: worker startup opens a unix socket whose path is capped near 108 characters, and a long scratch path overflows it. |
| CUDA OOM while collecting the latent bank | Lower `--batch-size`. Latent capture already runs under `no_grad`; without it π₀.₅'s vision tower would exhaust a 24 GB card on its own. |
| Environment count does not divide the trial count | `n_envs = b_t × n_delays`, with `b_t` derived from `--cpu-fraction` and the host core count. Pick a fraction that makes `b_t` divide the per-task trial count — with 4 delays and 50 trials on a 128-core host, `0.32` gives `b_t = 10`. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: lerobot` | Install LeRobot in the environment, or set `LEROBOT_ROOT` / pass `--lerobot-root` to a checkout containing `src/`. |

**Three action spaces, never interchangeable.** BANK (`qnorm(env)`) is what the latent bank stores
and what the motion prior consumes; ENV (physical OSC deltas) is what the state correction module
forward-integrates; POLICY (`(env − mean)/std`) is what the flow head operates in.
`common/action_space.py` is the only place these convert.
