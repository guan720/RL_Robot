Dual Franka
===========

RPent can control a two-node dual-Franka setup through an RLinf
``RealWorldEnv`` worker.

Install
-------

.. note::

	The following guide installs only the Python side (the custom RLinf
	Franka branch and ``rlinf-openpi``); it does **not** build the robot-node
	control stack the two arms need. Before installing RPent, follow the RLinf
	dual-Franka guide to set up both robot nodes: choose a compatible
	``LIBFRANKA_VERSION``, build the ``franka-franky`` (franky/libfranka) control
	stack, configure the PREEMPT_RT real-time kernel and permissions, and install
	the GELLO teleoperation and gripper dependencies. See the `RLinf dual-Franka
	guide
	<https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/examples/embodied/dual_franka.html>`_.

From the RPent repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv sync --extra franka --extra sam3

This installs the custom RLinf Franka branch and ``rlinf-openpi`` into
``.venv``.

Calibration
-----------

Hand-eye calibration is performed with ROS
`easy_handeye <https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/easy_handeye>`_. Calibrate both
projection cameras against the right arm's base frame (two eye-on-base
calibrations): ``base_camera`` (the third-person RealSense) and ``d455_camera``.
The two wrist cameras (``left_wrist`` and ``right_wrist``) are observation
only — they feed the VLA policy views and the close-up planner snapshots, and
RPent never back-projects pixels through them — so they need no hand-eye
calibration.

Easy_handeye saves one YAML per camera under ``~/.ros/easy_handeye/`` by default.
RPent loads those YAMLs directly: list them under ``perception.calibration`` in
the robot config, mapping each camera to its easy_handeye YAML (the checked-in
``robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml`` already does this):

.. code-block:: yaml

   perception:
     calibration:
       base_camera: ~/.ros/easy_handeye/third_to_right_base_calib_eye_on_base.yaml
       d455_camera: ~/.ros/easy_handeye/d455_to_right_base_eye_on_base.yaml

Paths may be absolute, ``~``-prefixed, or relative; relative paths resolve
against the working directory RPent is launched from.

Development configuration
-------------------------

Review and edit the checked-in development defaults before enabling motion:

* ``robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml`` contains the machine identity (both
	robot IPs, camera serials/types, gripper connections), workspace geometry
	(target poses and safety limits), the easy_handeye YAML mapping (see
	Calibration), and perception localization bounds + base-frame transform.

RPent translates this robot-focused schema into the internal two-node RLinf
cluster and environment objects. To use a different file, pass
``--robot-config /path/to/robot_config.yaml``.

Start the two-node Ray cluster
------------------------------

The two nodes have fixed, different roles (defined in
``robots/dual_franka/runtime_config.py``):

* Node ``0`` is the Ray head: it runs the dual-Franka environment
	worker (all cameras, perception, and arm/gripper state), and the **left**
	arm's real-time controller. For the VLA task, the
	local VLA server also runs here.
* Node ``1`` is a Ray worker: it runs only the **right** arm's real-time
	controller, with no cameras and no RPent process.

Set ``RLINF_NODE_RANK`` before starting Ray on each controller node.

Node ``0``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export RLINF_NODE_RANK=0
   ray stop --force
   ray start --head --port=6379 --node-ip-address=HEAD_IP

Node ``1``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export RLINF_NODE_RANK=1
   ray stop --force
   ray start --address=HEAD_IP:6379 --node-ip-address=WORKER_IP

Run a smoke test
----------------

Task ``0`` tests conservative single-arm analytic motion and gripper primitives:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --extra franka rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 0 \
     --planner claude_code --model claude-opus-4-8 \
     --robot-config robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml

RPent starts ``robots/dual_franka/env_server.py`` with the current interpreter,
loads the RPent robot config, generates the internal RLinf adapter config,
connects to Ray, waits for ``healthz``, and records the initial state as step
``0``. Task ``0`` does not load the VLA.

VLA grasp demo
--------------

RPent provides a demo that uses a VLA to grasp objects. Task ``1`` exposes
``vla_right_grasp`` / ``vla_handoff`` / ``vla_left_place`` and can start the dual-Franka VLA server locally.
``PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH`` points to the trained Pi-05 checkpoint, while
``DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID`` is the dataset ID used to locate matching normalization
statistics:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH=/path/to/checkpoints/global_step_N
   export DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID=org/dual-franka-tcp-rot6d

   uv run --extra franka rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 1 \
     --cuda-device 0 \
     --planner claude_code --model claude-opus-4-8 \
     --robot-config robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml

The checkpoint must contain:

.. code-block:: text

   actor/model_state_dict/full_weights.pt
   <DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID>/norm_stats.json

**Pretrained checkpoint**

A ready-made task ``1`` checkpoint is published on ModelScope:
`Brunchlife/pi05-dualfranka-tcp-rot6d-clean-desk-532-delect-76000
<https://modelscope.cn/models/Brunchlife/pi05-dualfranka-tcp-rot6d-clean-desk-532-delect-76000>`_.
Download it, point ``PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH`` at the downloaded directory, and set
``DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID`` to the subdirectory that holds ``norm_stats.json``:

.. code-block:: bash

   modelscope download \
     --model Brunchlife/pi05-dualfranka-tcp-rot6d-clean-desk-532-delect-76000 \
     --local_dir /path/to/pi05-dualfranka-clean-desk

   export PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH=/path/to/pi05-dualfranka-clean-desk

.. warning::

	This checkpoint is trained only on our in-house test environment (robot
	poses, cameras, workspace layout, and objects), so it is expected to
	generalize poorly to a different setup. To deploy on your own rig, collect
	demonstrations and fine-tune your own checkpoint with RLinf by following the
	`RLinf dual-Franka guide
	<https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/examples/embodied/dual_franka.html>`_
	(collect GELLO demos, convert to tcp_rot6d, run SFT, then deploy).

When ``--vla-endpoint`` is absent, RPent starts
``rpent/robots/components/pi05_vla_server.py`` and loads
``pi05_dualfranka_tcp_rot6d`` once.

To run the VLA service separately:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --extra franka python -m rpent.robots.components.pi05_vla_server \
     --embodiment dual_franka \
     --model-path /path/to/checkpoints/global_step_N \
     --repo-id org/dual-franka-tcp-rot6d \
     --cuda-device 0 --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6000

Then pass ``--vla-endpoint http://VLA_HOST:6000`` to ``rpent``. An external
endpoint always takes precedence over local auto-start.

External environment server
---------------------------

To attach RPent to an already-running dual-Franka environment service:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --extra franka rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 0 \
     --env-endpoint http://ROBOT_HOST:PORT \
     --planner claude_code --model claude-opus-4-8 \
     --robot-config robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml

Tools and artifacts
-------------------

The extension exposes ``view_env_state``, ``view_camera_meta``, ``move_delta``,
``rotate_delta``, ``open_gripper``, ``close_gripper``, and ``vla_right_grasp`` / ``vla_handoff`` / ``vla_left_place``. Each
analytic motion selects exactly one arm, ``left`` or ``right``. Mutating tools
capture per-arm state and synchronized left-wrist, base, and right-wrist images
in RPent's central ``EnvState``.

Safety
------

Keep operators at both emergency stops. Validate task ``0`` with very small
single-arm motions before attempting a grasp. Stop when camera/state results
disagree, when the requested motion is not reached, or when any calibration is
uncertain.

Manual skill testing
--------------------

The deployment scripts live in ``robots/dual_franka/``. From the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   robots/dual_franka/run_manual_skill.sh --list-primitives
   robots/dual_franka/run_manual_skill.sh --schema vla_right_grasp

Use ``--primitive NAME --params JSON`` to call a tool. ``--task-id`` selects
the task's configured ``vla_instruction`` for named VLA skills; the planner's
segment prompt is recorded separately. Existing clean-desk tasks retain their
checkpoint's original training instruction. ``--robot-config`` selects the
machine configuration; its ``perception.calibration`` mapping points at the
easy_handeye hand-eye YAMLs. Local SAM3 requires the ``sam3`` extra; a remote
SAM3 service can be attached with ``--sam3-endpoint``.

Robot Codex profile isolation
----------------------------------------

Evaluation requires a plain TTY without ``--interactive`` or Dashboard.
Exploration supports ``--explore --interactive`` through the operator input broker;
Dashboard feedback remains unsupported. Evaluation
also exposes ``request_operator_verdict`` and requires a verdict before finish.
``request_scene_reset`` remains exploration-only.

The deployment wrappers select ``RPENT_CODEX_HOME`` (default:
``.codex-rpent-live`` inside the checkout), not the coding shell's
``CODEX_HOME``. Memory defaults to its ``memory`` subdirectory and the Codex
state database uses the dedicated directory too. Create a private ``config.toml``
there if needed; do not overwrite existing private settings.

For API deployments, explicitly set ``RPENT_CODEX_API_KEY`` and optionally
``RPENT_CODEX_BASE_URL``. The wrappers clear inherited ``CODEX_API_KEY``,
``CODEX_BASE_URL``, ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` and ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``. Otherwise,
authenticate separately in the dedicated profile. File-based credential storage
can be configured; check private configurations for shared OS keychain use.
Never commit credentials, private configuration or session records.

``RPENT_CODEX_MODEL``, ``RPENT_REASONING_EFFORT`` and
``RPENT_CODEX_SERVICE_TIER`` default to ``gpt-5.5``, ``medium`` and ``fast``.
These isolation rules apply to the deployment wrappers, not the generic RPent
CLI. Prefer invoking a wrapper: sourcing its environment script directly changes
the current shell's environment.

Directory isolation is not a security sandbox or workspace-file isolation.
The planner explicitly uses no interactive approvals and full filesystem access.
Editing private configuration does not override the planner's
explicit permissions. The connectivity probe remains read-only.

Attended exploration
--------------------

``dual_franka --explore`` waits for operator scene confirmation before robot
reset and records human verdicts with observation evidence. It reuses
RPent's exploration sessions and layered memory while retaining the existing
real-robot RGB/depth/state logs. This does not enable single-arm ``franka``
exploration.

Robots opt into human-interactive exploration through
``RobotSpec.supports_human_interactive_exploration``. The five operator commands
appear in interactive help only when this capability is active in exploration mode.

.. code-block:: bash

   rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 0 --explore --interactive \
     --robot-config /path/to/robot.yaml \
     --memory-dir /path/to/memory/dual_franka \
     --explore-attempts-per-session 3 --explore-sessions 2 \
     --output-dir /path/to/new-run

Configure the planner and task-1 VLA as described above. The client skips its
usual reset-on-connect during exploration; underlying hardware initialization
still follows RLinf's own lifecycle. Every session must call
``request_scene_reset`` before motion. The operator restores the physical scene
and replies ``done``; only a successful robot reset with camera/state capture
starts an attempt. Reset failures keep motion blocked.

``request_operator_verdict`` records a fresh observation and asks for
``success``, ``failure``, ``continue`` or ``abort``, with optional notes.
``solved()`` uses the current operator verdict. Motion and ``continue`` clear
previous verdicts. Abort/EOF permits ending without spending the remaining
attempt budget.

With ``--interactive``, reply using ``/operator <request-id> <answer>`` as shown
in the terminal; other lines remain planner steering. Without it, answer the
terminal prompt directly. A TTY is required. Dashboard operator feedback is not
implemented, so Dashboard exploration is rejected before runtime startup.

Each ``sessions/session_<NNN>/`` retains the existing artifacts plus per-step
``exploration.json`` and session-level ``operator_events.json``. Failed attempts
remain in the trace. Memory reads use ``suite`` and ``global``; working notes go
into the task inbox's ``wip/``. After success, draft suite/global lessons in the
inbox; the runner exports the winning attempt's command sequence and adds
operator evidence to its task audit. Recorded coordinates are not automatically
replayed. ``--auto-merge-memory`` is opt-in and invokes the existing memory
merge/index workflow only on successful, error-free exploration runs, including
the ``task_only`` audit/recipe pair.

Prompts are selected by ``robots/dual_franka/prompt_bundle.py``. Evaluation uses
``prompts/system.py`` and ``prompts/user.py``; exploration uses
``prompts/explore.py``. ``tasks.py`` owns task instructions, success criteria and
constraints; ``robot_spec.py`` supplies the rendering variables. Continuation
system prompts retain the task context. The original LIBERO exploration prompt
lives in ``robots/libero/prompts/explore.py``; its simulator reset/termination
assumptions are not inherited by the real robot.

External ``--env-endpoint`` servers must also be updated and advertise
``explicit_reset_only=True``; older servers are rejected before client reset.
Offline tests use fake hardware. Physical reset convergence, camera freshness
and task judgment still require validation on the deployed robot.

Direct interactive verdicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``dual_franka --explore --interactive``, submit ``/success`` or ``/failure``
on its own to finish exploration through program control. Bare ``success`` and
``failure`` remain ordinary planner messages. Success requires a confirmed attempt;
failure can also end the run before the initial reset. The first terminal verdict wins.
The command never reaches the planner as chat. New tool calls are refused and
active work is cancelled at its next supported boundary; an outstanding robot
RPC or inference must return before finalization. A fresh observation backs the
operator verdict. With ``/success``, the successful recipe/audit pair is published through the
existing memory merger to ``task_only`` before exit, even without
``--auto-merge-memory``. With ``/failure``, failure evidence stays in the run directory
and no successful memory is published. Observation or persistence errors are reported as failures.
Scene reset accepts ``/done`` or ``/operator <request-id> done``. Restart the running
CLI after updating to enable this behavior.

Other operator commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``/done`` confirms only the currently pending scene-reset request.
* ``/continue`` answers only the currently pending verdict request and resumes
  the attempt without marking it successful or ending the session.
* ``/abort`` cancels exploration at the supported boundary and exits, retaining
  an abort record without publishing success memory. It does not require a working camera.

Shortcuts without a matching pending request are refused, never buffered for a
future request. All five bare words without ``/`` remain ordinary agent messages.
The request-ID form ``/operator <request-id> <answer>`` remains supported.

Direct commands do not invoke a separate global/suite memory synthesis stage.
Existing planner errors remain errors and prevent automatic memory publication.

VLA diagnostic console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the standalone console for prediction recording and explicit execution.
The existing manual primitive entry remains ``robots/dual_franka/run_manual_skill.sh``.
Diagnostics do not register task IDs 103/104 or dispatch through the shared runner.
``--task-id`` selects an existing VLA task profile (default 1); the policy instruction
comes from its ``vla_instruction`` unless overridden with ``--instruction``.
Run the following command from a source checkout. The diagnostic initializes only
the environment and VLA components; configured SAM3 services are not started or contacted.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m tests.e2e_tests.dual_franka.dual_franka_vla --task-id 1 \
     --robot-config /path/to/robot.yaml \
     --vla-model-path /path/to/checkpoint --vla-repo-id org/dataset

Commands: ``prompt <instruction>``, ``infer`` (no execution), ``step``
(fresh prediction and execution), ``run N`` (1–20 chunks), ``reset``, ``quit``.
Initialization may reset the robot. Inputs and predictions are saved before
execution as JSON/NPZ. Invalid observations/actions are rejected; uncertain
execution blocks further motion until restart. RPC success is not task success.
Action validation expects 20 steps per prediction chunk. For a checkpoint with a
different chunk length, set ``--expected-action-steps`` explicitly to match it.
External model servers use the standard VLA prediction and health-check RPCs.
